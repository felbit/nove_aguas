# Nove Copos de Água

A fun little Friday-evening project to dive into Qt widgets and do something 
for my health on the way.

## Install

The Releases page has a ZIP archive attached to each release. 
Just download, unzip, and start the `NoveAguas` binary.

## License

I want to thank my wife for luring me into the rabbit-hole of Qt programming. 
It's her fault.

Oh, yes ... **license**: This project uses Qt and therefore needs to mention the GPL 
license Qt is distributed under. But with the code I wrote myself: 
do whatever you want. It's not very deep, and completely free.
